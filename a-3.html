            <div class="article-content">
                <p>As we approach 2025, the web development landscape is undergoing a dramatic transformation. New technologies, frameworks, and methodologies are reshaping how we build and experience the web. Let's explore the most significant trends that will define web development in 2024 and beyond.</p>
                
                <h2>1. AI-Powered Development</h2>
                <p>Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing web development in unprecedented ways. AI-powered code generators, automated testing, and intelligent debugging tools are becoming standard in modern development workflows.</p>
                
                <p>"AI is not just a trend; it's fundamentally changing how we write code," says Sarah Chen, senior developer at TechCorp. "We're seeing AI assistants that can generate entire components, suggest optimizations, and even predict potential bugs before they occur."</p>
                
                <h2>2. WebAssembly (WASM) Adoption</h2>
                <p>WebAssembly continues to gain momentum as developers seek near-native performance in the browser. Major applications like Figma, AutoCAD, and even video editing tools are now running in the browser thanks to WASM.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Near-native execution speed for complex applications</li>
                    <li><strong>Language Flexibility:</strong> Support for C++, Rust, Go, and other languages</li>
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Sandboxed execution environment</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>3. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) Evolution</h2>
                <p>PWAs are evolving beyond simple mobile web apps. Modern PWAs now offer native-like experiences with advanced features like background sync, push notifications, and offline functionality.</p>
                
                <p>Key improvements include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enhanced offline capabilities with intelligent caching</li>
                    <li>Advanced push notification systems</li>
                    <li>Seamless app store integration</li>
                    <li>Improved performance and user experience</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>4. Micro-Frontend Architecture</h2>
                <p>Large organizations are increasingly adopting micro-frontend architectures to scale their development teams and improve maintainability. This approach allows different teams to work on different parts of the application independently.</p>
                
                <h2>5. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)</h2>
                <p>The performance benefits of SSR and SSG are driving widespread adoption. Frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js, and Astro are making it easier than ever to build fast, SEO-friendly applications.</p>
                
                <h2>6. CSS-in-JS and Modern Styling</h2>
                <p>CSS-in-JS solutions are becoming more sophisticated, offering better performance and developer experience. Styled-components, Emotion, and other libraries are evolving to provide better runtime performance and developer tools.</p>
                
                <h2>7. TypeScript Dominance</h2>
                <p>TypeScript has become the de facto standard for large-scale web applications. Its adoption continues to grow as teams recognize the benefits of type safety in reducing bugs and improving maintainability.</p>
                
                <h2>8. Performance-First Development</h2>
                <p>Core Web Vitals and performance metrics are now central to web development. Developers are prioritizing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) optimization</li>
                    <li>First Input Delay (FID) improvements</li>
                    <li>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) prevention</li>
                    <li>Bundle size optimization and code splitting</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>9. Accessibility-First Design</h2>
                <p>Web accessibility is no longer an afterthought. Modern frameworks and tools are building accessibility features into their core, making it easier to create inclusive web experiences.</p>
                
                <h2>10. Edge Computing and CDN Evolution</h2>
                <p>Edge computing is transforming how we deploy and serve web applications. CDNs are evolving into full application platforms, enabling serverless functions and dynamic content generation at the edge.</p>
                
                <h2>Future Outlook</h2>
                <p>Looking ahead to 2025, we can expect to see:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased adoption of Web Components and custom elements</li>
                    <li>More sophisticated AI-powered development tools</li>
                    <li>Enhanced browser APIs for advanced functionality</li>
                    <li>Greater focus on sustainability and green web development</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>"The web is becoming more powerful and more accessible than ever," concludes Alex Thompson, web development consultant. "These trends are not just about technology; they're about creating better experiences for users and more efficient workflows for developers."</p>
